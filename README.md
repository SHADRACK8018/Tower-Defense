# Tower Defense Game

A classic Tower Defense game built using Pygame, where players defend their base by strategically placing towers along a path to prevent enemies from reaching their goal.

## overview

The game starts with the player having a limited amount of resources. As waves of enemies approach, you must use those resources to place and upgrade towers along the enemies' path. Your goal is to prevent the enemies from reaching the end of the path and depleting your base's health.

## Features

Multiple Towers: Place different types of towers, each with unique attributes (damage, range, fire rate).
Multiple Enemies: Enemies come in waves with varying speed, health, and strength.
Progressive Difficulty: As the game progresses, enemy waves become harder.
Level System: Various levels with increasing difficulty and unique layouts.
Upgrade System: Upgrade towers to increase their power and effectiveness.
Score and Waves: Track your score based on the number of enemies defeated and how many waves you've survived.
